\paragraph{Collaboration Type}


Relationship between human and agent in human-computer collaboration \cite{EmpathyConcept}.

whether set collaborative task in virtual reality can improve empathy?

Adjust physical and physiological state to colloboratively finish a task and
feel oneself's state to infer other's state. This can be used for psycological 
trainning where a healthy people can help psychological disabled one to 
feel the normal inner state.


human adjust their physical or physiological signal to reach a level and computer
will change volume or picture color

Observer and target.

Agent can manipulate (augment or depress) elements from the computer side to 
change focus to create new meaning of current job.

In MR based collaborative environment, we research empathy between or among 
follolwing objects:
\begin{enumerate}
\item[1] human-human
\item[2] human-Agent
\item[3] agent-human
\item[4] agent-Agent
\item[5] human-agent-human
\item[6] agent-human-human
\item[7] agent-human group
\item[8] human-agent group
\item[9] huamn group-agent group     
\end{enumerate}


\section{PhD Research Plan}
\subsection{Summary}
\paragraph{}
Construct an engine to support most mixed
reality (MR) related scientific research.

Agent in MR environment help enhance understand and 
feeling of social presence.

\paragraph{MR content}
3D model will be placed on the web server.

\paragraph{Interaction}
Interaction depends intensively on terminal devices

\paragraph{Display}
Display is also constrained by terminal devices.

\paragraph{AI}
Integrate artificial intelligence to construct Agent
that can sense, express and regulate emotion

    \subparagraph{Datasource}
    Data comprises physical and physiological signals.
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item[1)]
    physical signals includes images, voices and so on.
    \item[2)]
    Physiological signals comprises Electroencephlogram(EEG), Electrocardiogram
    (ECG), etc..
    \end{enumerate}
